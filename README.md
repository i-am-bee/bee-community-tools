  <h4 align="center">Agentic tools that support the Bee Agent Framework</h4>
</p>

The tools in this repository are additional to those provided within the core bee-agent-framework. They provide access to various functions that enable agents to connect to a variety of different capabilities. More information about developing tools for Bee can be found in the [tools documentation](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework/blob/main/docs/tools.md).

## Getting started with Bee Community Tools

### Installation

```shell
yarn install
```

### Run an example agent with tools

We provide example agents for tool usage in `examples/agents/` that you can use to test tools.

```shell
yarn start
```

The `allToolsAgent` example agent is configured to use a BAM, Watsonx, OpenAI hosted LLM, or a local Ollama LLM.
If you are using a hosted LLM make sure to create .env (from .env.template) and fill in the necessary API_KEY.

> [!NOTE]
> The Hello World example tool is not enabled by default.

> [!TIP]
> Tools can be enabled/disabled in `examples/agents/allToolsAgent.ts`
